openSUSE specific rpmlint checks

when adding or modifying a test make sure to update
https://github.com/openSUSE/rpmlint-tests as well!

Wwith RPMLint 2.0 the checks are merged and obsolete in upstream git repo:
  https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint

If you have a bugfix check the code there if it is affected.
If you are developing a new functionality just directly go there and do not add new tests here.
