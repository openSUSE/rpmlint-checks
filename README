Deprecated, please submit openSUSE checks first to
upstream: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint

== openSUSE specific rpmlint checks ==

when adding or modifying a test make sure to update
https://github.com/openSUSE/rpmlint-tests as well!

With RPMLint 2.0 (used in openSUSE Tumbleweed) the checks are merged and
obsolete in upstream git repo: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint

If you have a bugfix check the code there if it is affected.

If you are developing a new functionality just directly go there and do not add new tests here.
